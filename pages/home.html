            <p class="pt-6 pb-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Reem Azhari, founder of Thurmont Education, holds a Ph.D. in Business Psychology with a focus on Organizational Leadership. She has been a nurse leader and educator for over twenty years, bringing a background in management, administration, and university education as a former endowed chair and full professor.

            <p class="pt-6 pb-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The sudden death of her youngest son, Adam, has fueled her passion for working with people experiencing grief. As a mother and an academic researcher, it became clear to her that this pain needed to be turned into purpose. The establishment of Thurmont Education is that purpose. In her personal experience with grief, she was made aware of the resources needed to push through the pain and find meaning in life and in helping others.  At Thurmont Education, support is provided through various means with <a href="/resources#partners" class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold hover:underline" target="_self">our wonderful partners in health and well-being</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="pt-6 pb-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                At Thurmont Education, support is also provided to managers, leaders and all workforce employees. The workforce possesses many challenges and having a background in organizational management has allowed Dr. Azhari and her team of educators to successfully coach employees and leaders to become better and more satisfied in their jobs as they help them understand themselves as well as others around them. Through one on one coaching and personality profile testing, the coaches at Thurmont Education will work with your associates to bring out the best in their performances leading to a happier and well balanced work climate.

                Reem is a published researcher and has presented both locally and globally on topics related to United Nations Partnerships, Scholarly Writing and Vulnerable Populations. With Adam's death she hopes to continue her research focusing on parental and generational grief. She has also begun researching grief, associate satisfaction and resilience in the American workforce.
